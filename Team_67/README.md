## Project Title
Adaptive Stress Mitigation for Cognitive Enhancement

## Description
This project presents a real-time, non-intrusive system to monitor eye stress and cognitive fatigue using eye-blink analysis. The system uses a standard webcam to capture live video, detect facial landmarks, and compute the Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) to accurately identify eye blinks.

By analyzing blink frequency and EAR variations over time, the system classifies stress levels such as normal, mild stress, and high stress without relying on complex deep learning models or wearable sensors. The solution supports both single-user and multi-user monitoring, making it suitable for classrooms, offices, and digital learning environments.

The project emphasizes real-time performance, low computational cost, user privacy, and ease of deployment, providing timely visual feedback and alerts to help reduce digital eye strain and improve overall cognitive well-being.
